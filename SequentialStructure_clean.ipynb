    "# Interactive Structured Bond **LIVE VERSION**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this interactive notebook (created with Python and Jupyter) we take a look at the performance of a structured finance deal under various degrees of stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical deal structure would hold an underlying asset (e.g. a portfolio of Receivables, Non-Performing Loans or Real Estate) that forms the basis for the transaction and is the generator of cash flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deal structure\n",
    "By taking into account the objectives of the various potential investors it is possible to come up with a structure that would be satisfactory to all parties. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular prudent investors would like to receive their share of the anticipated returns and the associated cash flows first in line (\"Senior\"). This could be achieved by assigning the largest part of cash to first to Senior tranches and thereafter to Junior noteholders and lastly Equity to the more risk- tolerant investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of assigning cash flows sequentially is called a \"Waterfall\"; Imagine a waterbed in which the water flowing over (and filling up) first interest payments, then amortising the upper (senior) echelons and later the more junior and downriver sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course there are many possible technicalities to a deal including paydown mechanics (sequential, pro-rata) and other items in the waterfall (expenses, liquidity providers) but the main principle is to allocate or \"tranche\" the available cash flows as described above. Certain transactions also get assigned a standardised level of perceived riskyness (e.g. \"triple-A\" or \"single-B\") by rating agencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenarios\n",
    "When structuring a deal you would run many simulations to assess how well it would perform under various scenarios such as fall in asset value, delay to collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this in interactive example we have three classes of bonds to be paid down in sequence starting with the most senior \"A\" tranche which (as it is the least risky pays the least interest amount). Subsequently what is left of cash flows goes to equity (one could assume that the most junior pieces would be kept with the deal originator keeping its skin in the game).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically in this example we have the following tranche sizes: A 60%, B 30% and Junior 10%.\n",
    "Interest rates (increase with level of risk): A 5%, B 7% and Junior 12%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactive model\n",
    "By moving the sliders (see technical note) below you can explore what effect loss in value and/or delays have to the paydown of the principal and the income to equity in a typical deal. Note that when there is not enough cash to pay interest (top priority) in a period, the missing amount would be capitalised (added to the corresponding bond tranche).\n"
